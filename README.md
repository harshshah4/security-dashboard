## 1. Goal
The IT Administrators manage the data center hardware using the data center management software. These administrators perform various operations on a daily basis that includes server management, network and storage management, backup and recovery. Additionally they have the critical responsibility of taking care of the security aspects of the software on a regular or need basis.  Typically these operations would take time and reducing the productivity.  Automation of such operations by providing suitable algorithms and configurability options through a web service would improve the productivity. Additionally the proposal would give an effective usability for the IT Administrators during this software release

## 2. Capabilities
 - List the ciphers that are supported
 - Configure the SSL for protocols and ciphers
 - Perform sample tests on appliance and provide the protocols used for testing
 - List the vulnerabilities that are handled in appliance CVEs for a given component
 - Provides public cert details
 - List the protocols that are supported


## 3. What makes it different?
There are various security scanners that are capable of scanning the ssl protocols and verify various ssl capabilities and provide the details. There are various commercial and open source products, but most of them are suitable for public domain servers or on line solutions. Also, they are limited to the ssl scanning and related aspects. There are also some advanced products and research attempts in this area that provide security details of the servers and browsers. Some of these capabilities are required for data center management software also. Additionally there are more security aspects around certificates, etc., that need to be reported for a smooth management of data centers using the manageability software.
